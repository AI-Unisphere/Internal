# Bid Evaluation Approaches

## 1. UN Procurement Evaluation Methods

The United Nations Procurement Division uses two main evaluation methods for contract awards:

### 1. **Lowest Responsive/Compliant/Acceptable Offer**
- **Focus**: Lowest price/cost among offers that meet all requirements.
- **Use Case**: Simple procurements (e.g., standard goods, raw materials) with clear specifications.
- **System**: One-envelope (all info together) or two-envelope (technical and financial evaluated separately).

### 2. **Weighted Scoring Method**
- **Focus**: Highest score based on weighted technical and financial criteria.
- **Use Case**: Complex procurements (e.g., services, specialized goods) where multiple factors must be balanced.
- **Weighting**: Financial offer typically accounts for 15-50% of the total score.
- **Process**: Technical proposals are evaluated first; only those meeting minimum requirements proceed to financial evaluation.

These methods ensure competitive and value-driven procurement tailored to the complexity of the requirements.

- **Purpose**: Ensure bids/proposals meet basic requirements without material deviations.
- **Application**: Preliminary check for compliance with procedures and processes.

#### 2.1.2. **Qualification Criteria**
- **Purpose**: Assess eligibility and qualifications of bidders/proposers.
- **Application**: Pass/fail assessment of mandatory qualification standards.

#### 2.1.3. **Minimum Technical/Performance Requirements**
- **Purpose**: Ensure bids/proposals meet essential technical standards.
- **Application**: Pass/fail assessment of minimum technical requirements.

#### 2.1.4. **Qualitative Rated Criteria**
- **Purpose**: Evaluate qualitative aspects like quality, sustainability, and technical methodologies.
- **Application**: Weighted scoring of technical aspects.
- **Examples**:
  - Methodology for delivering the project
  - Quality of the proposed team
  - Sustainability measures
  - Risk assessment and mitigation

### 2.2 Evaluation Process

#### 2.2.1. **Preliminary Evaluation**
- Check for completeness, eligibility, and qualification requirements.
- Filter out noncompliant bids/proposals.

#### 2.2.2. **Technical Evaluation**
- Apply rated criteria and weightings to evaluate technical aspects.
- Ensure bids/proposals meet minimum technical requirements.

#### 2.2.3. **Financial Evaluation**
- Evaluate financial costs, including life-cycle costing if applicable.
- Assess reasonableness of costs and check for abnormally low bids.

#### 2.2.4. **Combined Scoring**
- Combine technical and financial scores using predefined weightings.
- Determine the best value for money.

### 2.3 Tools and Examples

    - Examples of criteria include:
        - **Capacity and Experience of the Proposer**
            - Evidence of managing similar projects
            - Relevant technical expertise
            - Effective collaboration skills
            - Client feedback and references
        - **Proposed Approach or Solution**
            - Alignment with RFP goals
            - Focus on equity and inclusivity
            - Realistic timeline
            - Effective staffing plan

        - **Price**
            - Reasonableness of cost
            - Resource allocation efficiency
            - Ability to leverage additional resources

3.  **Determine Information Needs:**

    - Collect necessary information for each evaluation criterion.
    - Use various formats like narratives, specific questions, samples, interviews, and references.

4.  **Create Structured Evaluation Tools:**

    - Develop rubrics that include:
        - RFP criteria with descriptions and weights
        - Clear scoring scales (e.g., numerical or qualitative)
        - Quantitative methods for assessing price
        - Space for evaluators to note questions and gaps

5.  **Prepare and Align Evaluators:**

    - Ensure evaluators understand the RFP goals and their role.
    - Conduct training to promote consistency in scoring.
