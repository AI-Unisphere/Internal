## 1. UN Procurement Evaluation Methods

The United Nations Procurement Division uses two main evaluation methods for contract awards:

### 1. **Lowest Responsive/Compliant/Acceptable Offer**
- **Focus**: Lowest price/cost among offers that meet all requirements.
- **Use Case**: Simple procurements (e.g., standard goods, raw materials) with clear specifications.
- **System**: One-envelope (all info together) or two-envelope (technical and financial evaluated separately).

### 2. **Weighted Scoring Method**
- **Focus**: Highest score based on weighted technical and financial criteria.
- **Use Case**: Complex procurements (e.g., services, specialized goods) where multiple factors must be balanced.
- **Weighting**: Financial offer typically accounts for 15-50% of the total score.
- **Process**: Technical proposals are evaluated first; only those meeting minimum requirements proceed to financial evaluation.

These methods ensure competitive and value-driven procurement tailored to the complexity of the requirements.

## 2. World Bank Procurement Guidance: Evaluating Bids and Proposals

This document outlines the evaluation process for bids and proposals using rated criteria for procurement of goods, works, and non-consulting services.

### 2.1 Key Evaluation Criteria

#### 2.1.1. **Substantially Responsive Criteria**
- **Purpose**: Ensure bids/proposals meet basic requirements without material deviations.
- **Application**: Preliminary check for compliance with procedures and processes.

#### 2.1.2. **Qualification Criteria**
- **Purpose**: Assess eligibility and qualifications of bidders/proposers.
- **Application**: Pass/fail assessment of mandatory qualification standards.

#### 2.1.3. **Minimum Technical/Performance Requirements**
- **Purpose**: Ensure bids/proposals meet essential technical standards.
- **Application**: Pass/fail assessment of minimum technical requirements.

#### 2.1.4. **Qualitative Rated Criteria**
- **Purpose**: Evaluate qualitative aspects like quality, sustainability, and technical methodologies.
- **Application**: Weighted scoring of technical aspects.
- **Examples**:
  - Methodology for delivering the project
  - Quality of the proposed team
  - Sustainability measures
  - Risk assessment and mitigation

### 2.2 Evaluation Process

#### 2.2.1. **Preliminary Evaluation**
- Check for completeness, eligibility, and qualification requirements.
- Filter out noncompliant bids/proposals.

#### 2.2.2. **Technical Evaluation**
- Apply rated criteria and weightings to evaluate technical aspects.
- Ensure bids/proposals meet minimum technical requirements.

#### 2.2.3. **Financial Evaluation**
- Evaluate financial costs, including life-cycle costing if applicable.
- Assess reasonableness of costs and check for abnormally low bids.

#### 2.2.4. **Combined Scoring**
- Combine technical and financial scores using predefined weightings.
- Determine the best value for money.

### 2.3 Tools and Examples

#### 2.3.1. **Prioritization Matrix**
- Helps prioritize and weight rated criteria based on importance.

#### 2.3.2. **Comparative Scoring Methodology**
- Ensures fair comparison of technical and financial scores.

This guidance ensures a transparent, fair, and value-driven procurement process.

## 3. Harvard Kennedy School: Proposal Evaluation Tips & Tricks

This guide provides a comprehensive approach to proposal evaluation, emphasizing customization and strategic alignment with RFP goals. It outlines a structured, five-step process for customizing proposal evaluations:

### 3.1 Key Steps and Criteria:

1.  **Identify Evaluators:**

    - Recruit subject matter experts, including those familiar with the service or project.
    - Ensure impartiality and address potential conflicts of interest.
    - Balance perspectives without creating unwieldy committees.

2.  **Define Clear Evaluation Criteria:**

    - Align criteria with RFP goals, emphasizing technical and financial aspects.
    - Assign weights to criteria to reflect their relative importance.
    - Examples of criteria include:
        - **Capacity and Experience of the Proposer**
            - Evidence of managing similar projects
            - Relevant technical expertise
            - Effective collaboration skills
            - Client feedback and references
        - **Proposed Approach or Solution**
            - Alignment with RFP goals
            - Focus on equity and inclusivity
            - Realistic timeline
            - Effective staffing plan
            - Alignment of project management with program needs
            - Robust data collection and reporting plan
        - **Price**
            - Reasonableness of cost
            - Resource allocation efficiency
            - Ability to leverage additional resources

3.  **Determine Information Needs:**

    - Collect necessary information for each evaluation criterion.
    - Use various formats like narratives, specific questions, samples, interviews, and references.

4.  **Create Structured Evaluation Tools:**

    - Develop rubrics that include:
        - RFP criteria with descriptions and weights
        - Clear scoring scales (e.g., numerical or qualitative)
        - Quantitative methods for assessing price
        - Space for evaluators to note questions and gaps

5.  **Prepare and Align Evaluators:**

    - Ensure evaluators understand the RFP goals and their role.
    - Conduct training to promote consistency in scoring.

### 3.2 Strategic Considerations:

- **Balance**:
    - Fair and consistent treatment of all proposals.
    - Open communication to gather necessary information for thorough evaluation.
- **Flexibility**:
    - Utilize tools like interviews and demos for deeper insights.
    - Allow for clarification questions to enhance understanding.
- **Post-Evaluation**:
    - Conduct detailed debriefs with proposers to offer feedback and improve future submissions.
    - Use insights to refine and improve the evaluation process for upcoming RFPs.

This approach ensures that evaluations are not only fair and thorough but also strategically aligned with the RFP's intended goals, promoting better outcomes and continuous improvement.

* Financial offers will be scored out of 30 points. 30 points will be allocated to the lowest offers
among the technical acceptable offers. All other price proposals receive scores in inverse
proportion according to the following formula:
Score for price A = (30*Price of lowest priced proposal)/Price of proposal A
