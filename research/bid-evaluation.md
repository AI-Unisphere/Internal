# Bid Evaluation Approaches

## 1. UN Procurement Evaluation Methods

The United Nations Procurement Division uses two main evaluation methods for contract awards:

### 1. **Lowest Responsive/Compliant/Acceptable Offer**
- **Focus**: Lowest price/cost among offers that meet all requirements.
- **Use Case**: Simple procurements (e.g., standard goods, raw materials) with clear specifications.
- **System**: One-envelope (all info together) or two-envelope (technical and financial evaluated separately).

### 2. **Weighted Scoring Method**
- **Focus**: Highest score based on weighted technical and financial criteria.
- **Use Case**: Complex procurements (e.g., services, specialized goods) where multiple factors must be balanced.
- **Weighting**: Financial offer typically accounts for 15-50% of the total score.
- **Process**: Technical proposals are evaluated first; only those meeting minimum requirements proceed to financial evaluation.

These methods ensure competitive and value-driven procurement tailored to the complexity of the requirements.

- **Purpose**: Ensure bids/proposals meet essential technical standards.
- **Application**: Pass/fail assessment of minimum technical requirements.

#### 2.1.4. **Qualitative Rated Criteria**
- **Purpose**: Evaluate qualitative aspects like quality, sustainability, and technical methodologies.
- **Application**: Weighted scoring of technical aspects.
- **Examples**:
  - Methodology for delivering the project
  - Quality of the proposed team
  - Sustainability measures
  - Risk assessment and mitigation

### 2.2 Evaluation Process

#### 2.2.1. **Preliminary Evaluation**
- Check for completeness, eligibility, and qualification requirements.
