# 1. Procurement process / overview
Procurement is the process of acquiring goods, services, or works from external sources, ensuring that an organization's needs are met in a timely, cost-effective, and efficient manner. It involves several key stages, including planning, tendering, awarding contracts, and implementation, all aimed at securing the best value for the organization while adhering to ethical and legal standards.

# 2. Best practices / frameworks
## 2.1 Open Contracting Partnerships
Procurement for connectivity projects, such as those aimed at connecting every school to the internet by 2030 (Giga's mission), can greatly benefit from adopting *open contracting principles*. These principles promote transparency, accountability, and efficiency in public procurement processes.

### 2.1.1 Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS)
The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) is a free, non-proprietary open data standard for public contracting, implemented by over 30 governments around the world. It describes how to publish data and documents about contracting processes for goods, works and services. This helps standardise the data, and makes contracting data available for anyone to use, modify, and share, for any purpose. The OCDS is not an electronic procurement system or database. But it can inform how data is collected, stored and published in these systems. The OCDS can help make sure that the contracting data you collect and publish meet global best practices and are fit-for-purpose to meet the needs of a range of different users.

To facilitate publication of contracting data to meet a variety of needs, the OCDS provides:
- A common structured [data model](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/), including a schema, codelists, and common rules and definitions for data fields and contracting processes;
- [Guidance and](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/guidance/) tools to support implementation and data use;
- An [extension](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/guidance/map/extensions/) mechanism to add additional key information to your OCDS data; and
- Free global [support](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/support/) from the Data Support Team.
