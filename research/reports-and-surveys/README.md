## 3. Public Procurement in South Africa: Issues and Reform Options (2023)

### Key takeaways
**Current Challenges in Public Procurement**:

- **Fragmented Legislation and Processes**: Multiple legal instruments and varied procurement practices lead to inefficiencies and compliance burdens.
- **Limited Transparency**: Insufficient publication of bid documents, evaluation minutes, and contract implementation reports facilitates corruption.
